General BlackJack Manual for Dummies:

The goal of this game is to beat the dealer by making your hand closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over 21.
Each player will be dealt two cards to start. Each card has a value between 1-11: numbered cards equal their face value 
i.e. 2 of hearts=2 and 7 of diamonds equals 7, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are valued at 10, and an ace is valued at 
either 1 or 11 (the player may choose to "Switch" which will change the value of the ace from 1 to 11 or 11 to 1).
A hand's value is the sum of all their cards. If your hand is valued higher than the dealer's and equal to or below 21
you win. If your hand is lower than the dealer's or exceeds 21 you lose.
  
Help Option:

Once dealt two cards you will be given the option to Hit, Stand, or Switch Ace:
  If your hand is below 21 and you would like to increase the value of your hand, you may choose to "Hit"; this will signal
the dealer to deal you an additional card. You may continue to "Hit" as long as your cards value are less than 21.
  If you believe your hand is higher than the dealer's, you may choose to "Stand"; this will signal the end of your turn 
and the value of your cards will remain the same.
  If you have been dealt an Ace, you will have the option to "Switch Ace"; this will change the value of your ace from 1 to
11 or from 11 to 1 depending of the current value of your ace.
